PTMCMC: Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte-Carlo.

The aim of PTMCMC is to perform parallel tempering sampling.
In this implementation we provide an adaptive jump proposal scheme where the user can add custom jump proposals or use the default Adaptive Metropolis (AM) and Differential Evolution (DE) jump.
